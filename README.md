## Setup
1. Download the newest version of PyPy (skip if you're not planning on using PyPy).
2. Download the newest version of Anaconda (skip if you're not planning on using Anaconda).
3. Download or clone the repository.
4. Install the pip requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt -U`
5. Run the program! I included the related `.bat` and `.sh` files for running
the different runtimes as needed.
  * <b>Windows</b>:
    * [Clean.bat](Clean.bat): Deletes all compiled Python files
    (`*.c`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyd`, `*.so`) including the `__pycache__` folder, and delete any text files including the `files_runs` and `files_compile` folders.
    * [Compile_Python.py](Compile_Python.py): Runs [Clean.bat](Clean.bat), then
    recompiles all `*.py` files using the `py_compile` module, then uses Cython
    to compile all `*.pyx` files.
    * [Compile_Conda.py](Compile_Conda.py): Same as [Compile_Python.py](Compile_Python.py),
    but uses the Anaconda runtime. This will ask you to create an environment,
    which will use Python 3.7 and install cython and numpy automatically.

## Tests
  Each one of these programs has three different versions of calculating primes.<br>
  Using variable `N` as the number being tested for primality:<br>
  For prime numbers, we already know the following:
  * All prime numbers are odd numbers, except for 2.
  * All even numbers are divisible by 2, and therefore not prime.
  * We only need to start with 2 as the first prime number, then loop from 3
    to `N`, incrementing by 2 for each iteration to test only odd numbers.

#### Default Test
  * Check divisibility of `N` by each number less than `N`.

#### Half of N Bounding Test
  * Check divisibility of `N` by each number less than `math.floor((N / 2))`:
  * This method should theoretically be 2x as fast as the
  [default test method](#default).

#### Square Root of N Bounding Test
  * Check divisibility of `N` by each number less than `math.floor(sqrt(N))`:
  * This method should theoretically be log(N) as fast as the
  [default test method](#default).

# Implementations
### CPython Variants
#### CPython through Functions
  * Defined in [Find_Nth_Prime_Python.py](Find_Nth_Prime_Python.py)
  * Loops over all numbers from `0` to `max_num` as variable `N`, calls
  the test method functions for each of those numbers.
  * Since we're calling the each test method functions `N` times each, this means
  we have function call overhead of `max_num` calls per test method.

#### CPython Inline
  * Defined in [Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Inline.py](Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Inline.py)
  * Loops over all numbers from `0` to `max_num` as variable `N`, calls
  the test method functions for each of those numbers.
  * Since we're calling the each test method functions `N` times each, this means
  we have function call overhead of `max_num` calls per test method.

#### CPython through Functions with Lambdas
  * Defined in [Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Lambda.py](Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Lambda.py)
  * Only calls the calculation function once with a `max_num` as a parameter.
  * The calculation function handles all the logic that `Find_Nth_Prime_Python.py`'s the calculation functions have, but all using a single lambda function inside the calculation function.
  * This reduces the function call overhead, which can lead to significant time
  savings.

#### CPython through Functions with Lambdas
  * Defined in [Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Inline_Lambda.py](Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Inline_Lambda.py)
  * Only calls the calculation function once with a `max_num` as a parameter.
  * The calculation function handles all the logic that `Find_Nth_Prime_Python.py`'s the calculation functions have, but all using a single lambda function inside the calculation function.
  * This reduces the function call overhead, which can lead to significant time
  savings.

#### CPython with LRU Caching
  * Defined in [Find_Nth_Prime_Python_LRU.py](Find_Nth_Prime_Python_LRU.py)
  * Similar to the [Python](#cpython) in that the
  test method functions are each called `max_num` amount of times, but this
  implementation caches the results of previous function calls to speed up the
  calculation of the current function call.
  * Despite the supposed function call overhead

  * Defined in [Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Numpy_Lambdas.py](Find_Nth_Prime_Python_Numpy_Lambdas.py)

### Anaconda Variants
There are no differences in the code between these implementations and the CPython ones.
The only difference is that the exact same CPython tests were run with the
Anaconda Python runtime rather than the default CPython runtime.
